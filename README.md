# TicTacToe

This project will simulate the game TIC TAC TOE. It will use I/O, interrupt, and Display.
It will display the content of the game on the screen by coping the pixel patterns into the display memory. After that the pixel patterns are stored in an array in the same way that they will be written to the GLCD memory.
It will use an interrupt signal to notify the MSP432 that a key on the keypad has been pressed. The program will then respond according to the key that is pressed, allowing the users to play the game.
